Our motive is that we want to create an more affordable housing market. Investors of the house get a social return while renters can have cheaper housing. We want to remove the financial barrier of investing in real estate for investors that don\'t have the means to fully invest in a house themselves for a social return. In between the end-users, there is coordination taking place between different stakeholders to achieve the desired outcome. This is where the runtime and the logic of all pallets come together, orchestrating while adhering to strict rules set for an equitable system. The orchestration towards an equitable housing market is configurable and governable by the stakeholders that are concerned with it and are willing to work for it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
