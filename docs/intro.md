#  Intro

Let's discover **Fair Squares in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is it ? 

The Fair Squares (FS) platform enables fractional ownership of real estate for future rental agreements. With FS, the housing market becomes more transparent, fair and accessible for tenants, co-owners and investors. 
At its core, FS is a community-agreed protocol that executes rental agreements with the houses that were invested in. This makes it possible to have affordable housing with a return on social investments.
Individuals in communities can own, manage homes and new entrants can easily enter the rental market. The Fair Squares social crowd financing model allows us to achieve a 30% lower (free market) rent. By bundling the capital of co-investors combined with governance, this gives the stakeholders the tools to create an ecosystem that can be self-sovereign.
