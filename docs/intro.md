# Introduction to Fair Squares (FS)

Welcome to Fair Squares (FS) – a transformative platform designed to reshape the future of equitable real estate ownership. FS bridges the gap between homeowners, renters, properties, and investors. We're on a mission to create an affordable housing landscape where house investors not only see financial returns but also drive positive societal change, while renters find cost-effective housing solutions.

Our vision is to foster a housing market that’s transparent, equitable, and accessible for all participants: tenants, co-owners, and investors. Central to FS is a community-endorsed protocol that oversees rental agreements with properties that have been jointly invested in. This model allows communities to own and manage homes, welcoming new entrants into the rental landscape. Furthermore, our unique crowd-financing approach offers up to 30% lower rent compared to the free market, aligning the interests of stakeholders in a self-sovereign ecosystem.

### Our Mission and Vision

While our goal is to make the housing market more accessible and fair, it's also about empowering potential real estate investors. Many seek to make a social impact but may not have the resources for a direct property purchase. Our system encourages a coordinated effort among stakeholders, ensuring alignment towards our mission, all governed by strict standards for fairness and transparency. This adaptable model is driven by its stakeholders, ensuring housing equity remains at its forefront.

### How Does Fair Squares Operate?

### Our Approach

We envision Fair Squares not as a traditional business, but as a neutral housing protocol. The protocol's primary objective is to address the core need of housing, aiming to mold this into a universally consistent, predictable, and affordable solution. Revenue generated will be governed by its token holders, stemming from various transactions on the platform.

We're glad to have you on this journey towards a more equitable housing future. Welcome aboard!
