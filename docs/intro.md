# Introduction to Fair Squares (FS)

Welcome to Fair Squares (FS) – a protocol for pooled, impact‑aligned housing capital. Instead of tokenizing each individual property, assets are admitted into a collectively managed pool; investors hold fungible pool units whose value reflects the Net Asset Value (NAV) of all managed housing assets.

The protocol’s focus is affordability, transparency, and regulatory alignment. Investor capital expands the pool; approved housing corporations (external entities) handle day‑to‑day tenant relationships under standardized agreements. Operational performance and net cashflow data flow back, informing NAV progression and governance insight.

### Our Mission and Vision

While our goal is to widen access to stable, affordable housing, we also empower impact‑oriented investors lacking the capital or scale for direct property ownership. Coordinated governance (via Polkadot OpenGov tracks customized for FS) ensures high‑impact actions—like accrediting a new housing corporation or altering admission criteria—undergo the appropriate scrutiny and delay, while low‑risk parameter adjustments remain agile.

### Engage with Us

### How Does Fair Squares Operate?

### Our Approach

We envision Fair Squares as neutral infrastructure: an open coordination layer for housing capital allocation. Revenue (net operating income settlements from housing corporations, potential protocol fees) is routed transparently and reflected in pool economics. Token holders govern upgrade paths and risk parameters through configurable tracks—minimizing governance surface while maintaining resilience.

We're glad to have you on this journey towards a more equitable housing future. Welcome aboard!
