# Fair Squares in 5 Steps: Step 1 - The Housing Fund

## Funding Framework

The first step in our journey towards collaborative and affordable housing involves establishing a robust **Housing Fund**. This fund plays a pivotal role in pooling resources and directing them towards meaningful investments in housing assets. Here's how it works:

- **Capital Bonding**: Users bond their capital to the housing fund through a user-friendly platform interface. This process is straightforward and secure, ensuring your funds are well-managed.

- **Stable Token Repository**: The platform maintains a repository of user-specific stable tokens. These tokens represent your investment and are crucial for transparent and fair dealings.

- **Core Intent**: The primary goal of the Housing Fund is to facilitate housing investments. By pooling resources, we aim to create a significant impact in the housing sector.

- **Transparent Allocation**: Every user's investment is allocated in a transparent and fair manner. We believe in openness and equality in investment opportunities.

- **Investment Returns**: Investors receive returns proportional to their investment. The fund aims to acquire housing assets, and the returns are fractionalized, ensuring everyone gets a fair share of the profits.

## Collaborative and Affordable Housing

The Housing Fund is more than just an investment opportunity. It's a step towards creating collaborative and affordable housing solutions. Hereâ€™s what makes it special:

- **Open Account Policy**: The fund operates on an open account basis, welcoming anyone interested in making a positive impact in the housing sector.

- **Investment in Collaboration**: By investing in the fund, you become part of a larger community focused on making housing more accessible and affordable.

- **Asset Purchasing and Management**: The fund is used for purchasing and managing housing assets, ensuring that your investment is put to good use.

- **Pro-rata Returns**: Investors enjoy returns based on the proportion of their investment. The more you invest, the higher your share of the profits.
