# What is FS ?

**Fair Squares** connects supply and demand of house-owners & renters and houses & investors. Our motive is that we want to create a more affordable housing market. Investors of the house get a social return while renters can have cheaper housing. We want to remove the financial barrier of investing in real estate for investors that don't have the means to fully invest in a house themselves for a social return. In between the end-users, there is coordination taking place between different stakeholders to achieve the desired outcome. This is where the runtime and the logic of all pallets come together, orchestrating while adhering to strict rules set for an equitable system. The orchestration towards an equitable housing market is configurable and governable by the stakeholders that are concerned with it and are willing to work for it.

We are zooming much more on the problem definition, stakeholders and the solution in our paper on our [website](https://fair-squares.nl/). To learn more and get in touch with us, please join our [discord channel FS](https://discord.gg/5u3dxE49V5)

Our current development is funded by [Web3 Foundation Grants Program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program)

### How will it work ?

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6l1n9SsK-yc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### How will it be deployed ?

We are currently developing towards a standalone testnet with an interface so users can test the node-software online. We are looking to experiment and research further with the knowledge and software we have how we can transition towards legitimate software that can be deployed on a parachain. 


### What is the business model ?

There is no business-model for Fair Squares as we don't perceive it as a business. We are looking to build a neutral housing protocol that can be deployed with a simple formula, since the requirement is housing. We are looking to turn this idea into a protocol that works for everyone the same and is predictable and affordable to use. 

There will be earnings of the protocol that will be owned by it's token holders to decide what to do with it. The earnings will come from most transactions that are happening on the protocol, such as buying, renting, payments etc. 

### How does governance work ?

We are looking at three layers of governance for Fair Squares. 

1. __The Economic and Technical level: __allowing payment options, integrations of new KYC provider, economic parameter changes changes, protocol upgrades, liability, lawfulness, etc.

2. __Housing protocol level: __return-on-rent, appoint juror, listen to concerns, propose parameter changes.

3. __House level: __ maintenance, improvements, liability, insurance, representative and tenancy

### What is the token distribution ?

We are looking for a long term distribution of the tokens (ownership protocol and governance token) to ensure that the protocol ownership is widely distributed. The tokens will be distributed with participation in the protocol, you can think of investing, voting, selling and for the businesses that are participating. The use-case of the token will be governance and ownership of the protocol.
