# Lightpaper - Fair Squares

## Problem statement

### Tenants

The number of people in Europe paying more than 40% of their income on their housing costs is rising and is now at 10%. This is almost 50 million EU citizens who have less and less money to live on. Housing is becoming less and less affordable[^1].
The gap between social housing and the free market is large and growing. Current markets are profit maximization driven and affordable housing suffers from it.
Several reports on the state of housing in Europe show that the structural social housing problem is not being addressed well enough (European Pillar of Social Rights Cities Delivering Social Rights, 2020). There are 92 million (21%) Europeans at risk of poverty[^2].

### Co-owners & investors

We are at a socio-economic tipping point where savings in the bank are literally depreciating towards negative interest. For many people it is not feasible to invest in real estate with their own capital without using a middle-men service, such a tracker or fund. To add to that there is also an expertise required to invest in a house, which bigger funds have in house. Because not everyone has access to investment markets and opportunities, inequality will only increase [^3]. With FS we want to co-invest and co-share the earnings and the costs. Where investing means ownership of your share that is provable and sharing means that you
In the Netherlands there are on average €40,000 in savings per household, with 25% of the households having built up more than € 40,000 in savings. A new kind of independent coordination is needed to remove financial investment barriers by organizing a new transparent way to invest in housing. Instead of just facilitating total ownership, we offer fractional ownership which means your yield will be the rent. With Fair Squares we make an effective link between these new social share investors and focus on bridging the gap for affordable housing.

## The core of FS

FS directly connects supply and demand of homes, removing the financial barriers by investing in a home with several people. We offer an application that will significantly reduce transaction costs because the vital role of intermediaries is shrinking and/or changing. FS is set up to invest in houses that can be rented out, in which stakeholders can fulfill their professional role.
With FS, capital will be pooled from small investors to buy and rent real estate. The social crowd investors make a return on the rent (ROR). The level of the ROR is agreed upon by the community, with the aim of making more affordable rental housing possible. On the one hand, you invest to have your (savings) money yield more than in a bank, without taking on irresponsible risks. FS facilitates these socially responsible investments.

The real estate will be owned by a group of investors who reach consensus on the social return on capital they commit to the platform. This intention is recorded in and executed by the FS protocol for lower rental housing.

### Governance

FS evolves in consultation with the community. The governance module is essential for future
development of the protocol based on dialogue and discussion with the FS community.
The open nature of FS is shaped by allowing stakeholders to propose changes that comply with
legislation. The FS council is similar to Kusama, a group of people that at heart care for a more fair
housing market vote to the best of their ability. This is why the council should consist or organisations or
leaders that have expertise in real estate, housing and financing so they can steer the community to the
best direction.

### Verification

A major complexity of blockchains that interact with the outside world is to get correct information into the
blockchain. This is a lot easier for digital assets or shares, where you can take a median from various
sources and arrive at a correct price. This is different for real estate, two different appraisers can arrive at
different prices that can be far apart. FS will have to come up with a unique valuation mechanism that
can prevent fraud. This will be a combination of trusted professional resources and community
participation.

### Roles

FS is a network of stakeholders who can fulfill their role in the outside world and are paid for this by the
investors or tenants in exchange for these service demands. The FS network requires that the
stakeholders who provide a service are transparent and guarantee the service. A reputation system will
keep track of which roles are successfully delivering their share of the service to be provided.

In a blockchain, disagreements are difficult to resolve, unless there is a path designed for handling
disagreements. Since we are dealing with trust of actors in the real-world such as valuations or whether
a service has been done right or wrong, we need stakeholders who help the investors and tenants as
confidants in the system. This is a common problem in blockchains and it’s a hard problem to solve
because it makes you trust the judgment of one person.

With verification of the stakeholders and on-chain journalists (the community), we do not want to give
bad actors a chance. The stakeholders can be independent or participate through service providers'
offices, such as brokers or housing associations. The first vital roles we think of are appraisers,
inspectors, service providers, damage experts, brokers and notaries.

### Secondary Market / Exchange
Investors can own a fractional share of a property through FS. As soon as they no longer want to own it
or want to sell part of it, they can trade on the secondary market. These secondary markets are set up
specifically for that real estate object. This also applies to buyers, they can also place a bid on a share of
the property in the secondary market. As a result, the share in a property is always liquid.

### Renting
FS's core purpose is to rent out the acquired real estate objects. This logical sequence allows us to
create returns on investments. Tenants can sign up through a different interface connected to the same
blockchain. We expect tenants to sign up with FS as we expect rents to be lower compared to the free
rental housing market.

### Advantages

Why should we replace the current system with a decentralized application? We believe the cheaper access to capital and making  link to fair access to housing is possible. With this we can solve a major urgent socio-economic problem. Together with the FS pilot partners, we will map out what more fair housing can amount to and what the statistics are for people. And then create value and more living well-being for people from the ecosystem method, reputation-based.  The information sources below will be accessible live on the blockchain in connection with verified data (oracles) outside the FS Information ecosystem chain.

**Investors**

- Guaranteed social return on real estate co-investment through rental agreement or other financing agreements.
- Facilitating the management of investments, purchases and maintenance. 
- Owning a fraction of one or more real estate assets, that can be used as collateral for something else. 
- Secondary market to sell their a part or their full share of the property.

**Tenants**

- FS focus is to create more affordable housing, so renters are insured of lowest market prices.
- Stable leases and tenants protection as investors can change.
- Future-oriented with option to buy a rental house, save according to ownership

**Other stakeholders**

All stakeholders have a voice in the FS process. In order to design the first pilots for a future-proof, legally legitimate form, we are looking for municipalities and/or housing associations. Municipalities that want to concretely solve the housing problem and that the FS want to test mechanisms and experiment in the test environments. 


## How does Fair Squares work?

### Funding Environment

Users can bond their capital on the platform interface, which will be a stable token. This makes their capital available for a future investment in housing. The bond of the capital goes to the housing fund. This fund holds the entire amount of stable tokens of different users. All values ​​(investments) assigned by the users and the time of the investment are registered through the fund. Inclusion is the aim of the housing fund to allow as many (types of) investors as possible to participate. By tying their money, investors agree to the fact that their money can be placed in various real estate properties.

### Listing of assets/homes
We expect homeowners and brokers to be able to list property on FS. This is a fraud sensitive topic because FS will become an open system. Before a house is fully placed and can be bid on, we expect that we can place checks with the necessary stakeholders such as notary and verifiers for approval and another quality check done by the fs-community. 

### Bidding and purchase module
Bidding on a house does not take into account bids outside the blockchain. A bidding mechanism based on the valuation report provides a price range. The FS stakeholders arrive at a bid price based on off-chain computations and on-chain voting. Before an offer can be made on a house, it must be known with which investors and how much money per investor together the total bid is formed. The general procedure to determine the minimum number of investors and the maximum investment amount per home will be further elaborated.

The intention is that an offer must be made quickly and then it is up to the seller or authorized representative to make a choice. There are still security checks here before the house can actually be handed over to the buyers. Such as a notary check, so that the house cannot be sold twice. If the bid is successful, the property will be transferred to the new owners and the money transferred to the former owner in its most simplistic 

To verify that the house is sold only at one place, this falls under the verification of a notary that we expect to be part of our solution. 


### Renting in FS
Registering for a rental can be done via another interface. Tenants can join by creating a profile with preferences. The interested tenants will be selected in the order of the steps below, namely:
1. With the registration, small deposit and verification, the potential tenant agrees to the FS rental guidelines. This process will be approved by an independent KYC provider.
2. The order of registration determines the position on the rental list. Preferences, such as location, m2, number of people. 
3. The tenant will receive a message with a proposal (deposit, rent, duration, etc.) and conditions of a house that is offered for rent. A set response time, then the proposal moves on to the next match. 

### Payouts 
The rental income will be distributed pro rata via the FS home via the wallet of the investors. The FS platform will have it’s platform fees automatically withheld as well. The amount of the FS fee is determinable by the council and/or the community, just like most governance parameters. There will be an option to reinvest the income in the platform and use it to automatically invest for a next real estate object.
