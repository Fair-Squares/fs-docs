## Problem statement

### Tenants housing costs

The number of people in Europe paying close high price for housing costs is at it's highest since ever. In 2021 people with disposable income below 60% of the median income are paying in europe on average 37.7%. These are also the group of people who could be considered as at risk of poverty. 

The gap between social housing and the free market is large and growing. Current markets are profit maximization driven and affordable housing suffers from it. The solution is to create a new market that is driven by social impact and not profit maximization. 

Several reports on the state of housing in Europe show that the structural social housing problem is not being addressed well enough (European Pillar of Social Rights Cities Delivering Social Rights, 2020). There are 92 million (21%) Europeans at risk of poverty[^1].

### Co-owners & investors

For many people it is not feasible to invest in real estate with their own capital without using a middle-men service, such as an ETF or fund. To add to that there is also an expertise required to invest in a house, which bigger funds have in house. Because not everyone has access to total funds and opportunities, inequality will only increase [^3]. With FS we want to create a co-investing and co-sharing the earnings and the costs opportunity. 

Where investing means ownership of your share that is provable and sharing means that you can rent out your share to a tenant. This way you can invest in a house with a group of people and share the costs and the earnings.

 A new kind of independent coordination is needed to remove financial investment barriers by organizing a new transparent way to invest in housing. Instead of just facilitating total ownership, we offer fractional ownership which means your yield will be the rent. With Fair Squares we make an effective link between these new social share investors and focus on bridging the gap for affordable housing.

## The core of FS

FS directly connects supply and demand of homes, removing the financial barriers by investing in a home with co-investors. We offer a solution that will significantly reduce transaction costs because the vital role of intermediaries is shrinking and this gives owners real-ownership instead of just a return on investment. 

With FS, capital will be pooled from small investors to buy and rent real estate. The social crowd investors make a return on rent (ROR). The level of the ROR is agreed upon by the community, with the aim of making more affordable rental housing possible. On the one hand, you invest to have your (savings) money yield more than in a bank, without taking on irresponsible risks. FS facilitates these socially responsible investments.

The real estate will be owned by a group of investors who reach consensus on the social return on capital they commit to the platform. This intention is recorded in and executed by the FS network for lower housing cost.

### Governance

FS evolves in consultation with the community. The governance module is essential for future development of the protocol based on dialogue and discussion with the FS community. The open nature of FS is shaped by allowing stakeholders to propose changes that comply with legislation. The FS council is similar to Kusama, a group of people that at heart care for a more fair housing market vote to the best of their ability. This is why the council should consist of organizations or leaders that have expertise in real estate, housing and financing so they can steer the community to the best direction. Furthermore the FS tokensholders will be connected to the democracy module and can vote on proposals.

### Verification

A major complexity of blockchains that interact with the outside world is to get correct information into the blockchain. This is a lot easier for digital assets or shares, where you can take a median from various sources and arrive at a correct price. 

This is different for real estate, two different appraisers can arrive at different prices that can be far apart. FS will have to come up with a unique valuation mechanism that can prevent fraud and somewhat trust in verified actors. This will be a combination of trusted professional resources and community participation.

### Roles

FS is a network of stakeholders who can fulfill their role in the outside world and are paid for this by the FS network for their services. The FS network requires that the stakeholders who provide a service are registered businesses. The expectation of these businesses that they   A reputation system will keep track of which roles are successfully delivering their share of the service to be provided.

In a blockchain, disagreements are difficult to resolve, unless there is a path designed for handling
disagreements. Since we are dealing with trust of actors in the real-world such as valuations or whether
a service has been done right or wrong, we need stakeholders who help the investors and tenants as
confidants in the system. This is a common problem in blockchains and it’s a hard problem to solve
because it makes you trust the judgment of one person.

With verification of the stakeholders and on-chain journalists (the community), we do not want to give
bad actors a chance. The stakeholders can be independent or participate through service providers'
offices, such as brokers or housing associations. The first vital roles we think of are appraisers,
inspectors, service providers, damage experts, brokers and notaries.

### Secondary Market / Exchange
Investors can own a fractional share of a property through FS. As soon as they no longer want to own it
or want to sell part of it, they can trade on the secondary market. These secondary markets are set up
specifically for that real estate object. This also applies to buyers, they can also place a bid on a share of
the property in the secondary market. As a result, the share in a property is always liquid.

### Renting
FS's core purpose is to rent out the acquired real estate objects. This logical sequence allows us to
create returns on investments. Tenants can sign up through a different interface connected to the same
blockchain. We expect tenants to sign up with FS as we expect rents to be lower compared to the free
rental housing market.


### Advantages

Why should we replace the current system with a decentralized application? We believe the cheaper access to capital and making  link to fair access to housing is possible. With this we can solve a major urgent socio-economic problem. Together with the FS pilot partners, we will map out what more fair housing can amount to and what the statistics are for people. And then create value and more living well-being for people from the ecosystem method, reputation-based.  The information sources below will be accessible live on the blockchain in connection with verified data (oracles) outside the FS Information ecosystem chain.

**Investors**

- Guaranteed social return on real estate co-investment through rental agreement or other financing agreements.
- Facilitating the management of investments, purchases and maintenance. 
- Owning a fraction of one or more real estate assets, that can be used as collateral for something else. 
- Secondary market to sell their a part or their full share of the property.

**Tenants**

- FS focus is to create more affordable housing, so renters are insured of lowest market prices.
- Stable leases and tenants protection as investors can change.
- Future-oriented with option to buy a rental house, save according to ownership

**Other stakeholders**

All stakeholders have a voice in the FS process. In order to design the first pilots for a future-proof, legally legitimate form, we are looking for municipalities and/or housing associations. Municipalities that want to concretely solve the housing problem and that the FS want to test mechanisms and experiment in the test environments. 


## How does Fair Squares work?

### Architecture FS
![Architecture FS main flow](/img/architecture-fs-process.png)

### Funding Environment

Users/Investors can bond their capital on the platform interface which is called the housing-fund. This makes their capital available for a future investment in housing. This fund holds the entire amount of stable tokens of different users. All value ​​(investments) assigned by the users and the time of the investment are registered through the fund. The purpose of this fund is solely to be used to invest in housing and allow as much as possible users by fair ordering to be allowed. By bonding their capital investors agree to the fact that their money can be placed in various real estate properties and the curation process of the next steps will decide whether the collective owned capital will invest in a house. 

### Listing of assets/homes
We expect homeowners, organizations and governmental institutions to be able to list property on FS. This is a fraud sensitive topic because FS will become an open system and we don't the housing fund immediately to be used for the first asset that is proposed. Before a house is fully onboard and can be bid on, it will have to get on-boarded which is done by on-chain curation by voting.   We have two governance bodies that are in charge of this process. 1st is the Housing council and the 2nd body is the investors-vote. If both of these bodies agree on the listing of a house, the house will be listed on the platform and can be bid on. 

### Bidding and purchase module
Bidding on a house does not take into account bids outside the blockchain. A bidding mechanism based on the valuation report provides a price. Before an offer can be made on a house, it must be known which investors and how much money per investor will form the total bid. This is done by our bidding-pallet, which is built to make only valid bids while adhering to first-come-first-serve principle and has to have a minimum and maximum of investors. The intention is to have a co-ownership over an asset so that we can lower the entry-barrier for ownership. 

After the bidding pallet has made a successful bid, it's up to the seller and after that for the notary to approve. The notary will not include all of it's information on-chain. There will be link in the title deeds in the land registry to the asset-registry of the new assets and it's holders. It's up to the notary and it's official role to do the background checks of the asset and the new owners. Such as a notary check, so that the house cannot be sold twice. If the bid is successful, the property will be transferred to the new owners and the money transferred to the former owner.

### New Ownership
The ownership of the house is now in the hands of the new owners. The new owners can now decide to rent out the house. The new owners can also decide to sell a part of their ownership to another investor. This is done by the secondary market. 

The asset itself has a treasury here are the maintenance fees, unexpected costs, etc. are paid from. The ownership will at all times have to vote over the outcome that is decided over an asset. Appointing a new representative, accepting a tenant, maintaining the house, etc.

The representative is the middle-man that is the point of contact for the tenants and the investors. It is a on-chain role, that is verified. The representative will be like a asset-manager that works at a housing association, but in our case it will have many different assets that belong to different groups. 

### Renting in FS
Registering for a rental can be done via another interface. Tenants can join by creating a profile with preferences. The interested tenants will be selected in the order of the steps below, namely:
1. With the registration, small deposit and verification, the potential tenant agrees to the FS rental guidelines. This process will be approved by an independent KYC provider.
2. The order of registration determines the position on the rental list in combination with geographical preference and the number of people in the household. The tenant can request  This information is not registered on-chain but passed on to the representative. 
3. When a tenant will receive a contract with a (deposit, rent, duration, etc.) of a rental house, it's up to the tenant to approve this and sign and deposit the required messages. 

### Payouts 
The rental income will be distributed pro rata via the FS asset to the fractional investors. The FS platform will have it’s platform fees automatically withheld as well. The amount of the FS fee is determinable by the council and/or the community, just like most governance parameters. There will be an option to reinvest the income in the platform and use it to automatically invest for a next real estate object.
