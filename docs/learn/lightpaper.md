# Lightpaper - Fair Squares

## Problem statement

### Tenants

The number of people in Europe paying more than 40% of their income on their housing costs is rising and is now at 10%. This is almost 50 million EU citizens who have less and less money to live on. Housing is becoming less and less affordable[^1].
The gap between social housing and the free market is large and growing. Current markets are profit maximization driven and affordable housing suffers from it.
Several reports on the state of housing in Europe show that the structural social housing problem is not being addressed well enough (European Pillar of Social Rights Cities Delivering Social Rights, 2020). There are 92 million (21%) Europeans at risk of poverty[^2].

### Co-owners & investors

We are at a socio-economic tipping point where savings in the bank are literally depreciating towards negative interest. For many people it is not feasible to invest in real estate with their own capital without using a middle-men service, such a tracker or fund. To add to that there is also an expertise required to invest in a house, which bigger funds have in house. Because not everyone has access to investment markets and opportunities, inequality will only increase [^3]. With FS we want to co-invest and co-share the earnings and the costs. Where investing means ownership of your share that is provable and sharing means that you
In the Netherlands there are on average €40,000 in savings per household, with 25% of the households having built up more than € 40,000 in savings. A new kind of independent coordination is needed to remove financial investment barriers by organizing a new transparent way to invest in housing. Instead of just facilitating total ownership, we offer fractional ownership which means your yield will be the rent. With Fair Squares we make an effective link between these new social share investors and focus on bridging the gap for affordable housing.

### The core

FS directly connects supply and demand of homes, removing the financial barriers by investing in a home with several people. We offer an application that will significantly reduce transaction costs because the vital role of intermediaries is shrinking and/or changing. FS is set up to invest in houses that can be rented out, in which stakeholders can fulfill their professional role.
With FS, capital will be pooled from small investors to buy and rent real estate. The social crowd investors make a return on the rent (ROR). The level of the ROR is agreed upon by the community, with the aim of making more affordable rental housing possible. On the one hand, you invest to have your (savings) money yield more than in a bank, without taking on irresponsible risks. FS facilitates these socially responsible investments.

The real estate will be owned by a group of investors who reach consensus on the social return on capital they commit to the platform. This intention is recorded in and executed by the FS protocol for lower rental housing.
