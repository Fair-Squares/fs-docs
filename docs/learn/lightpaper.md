## Challenges Addressed

### Escalating Housing Costs for Tenants

Europe currently observes an all-time high in people facing steep housing costs. In 2021, individuals with incomes below 60% of the median were paying an average of 37.7% towards housing. Significantly, this group also stands at potential risk of poverty.

There's a widening chasm between social housing and the free market, largely driven by profit-oriented market practices, to the detriment of affordable housing. We propose a shift to a socially impactful market instead of one solely profit-driven.

Recent European reports underscore that the persistent issues with social housing remain inadequately addressed (European Pillar of Social Rights Cities Delivering Social Rights, 2020). A concerning 21% of Europeans, approximately 92 million, are potentially facing poverty[^1].

### Equity Co-Owners & Investors

For a majority, direct real estate investment remains elusive without middle-men like ETFs or funds. Coupled with the expertise essential for home investment, the current scenario inadvertently propagates inequality[^3]. Fair Squares (FS) seeks to bridge this by fostering collective investment and shared gains.

FS facilitates fractional ownership, allowing investors to lease their share. This collective model promotes shared investment in, and benefits from, properties.

By introducing an innovative, transparent investment approach, Fair Squares aims to address the challenges of affordable housing while catering to the interests of socially conscious investors.

## Fair Squares Unveiled

FS seamlessly bridges home seekers and providers, dismantling financial constraints through co-investment opportunities. By curbing intermediary roles, we significantly trim transaction costs and promote genuine property ownership over mere ROI.

Pooling funds from individual investors, FS purchases and leases properties. The community-driven return on rent (ROR) aims to enable more affordable housing options. FS advocates secure and impactful investment opportunities.

Property ownership under FS relies on consensus by its investors about the intended social returns. These commitments are then anchored and facilitated by the FS platform, aiming to reduce housing expenses.

### Decentralized Governance

FS thrives through active community engagement. Our governance structure prioritizes evolving the protocol based on continuous dialogue with FS members. Taking a leaf from Kusama, the FS council comprises experts committed to promoting fair housing practices. Concurrently, FS token holders can participate through the democracy module, influencing decisions and proposals.

### Asset Verification

The unique challenge for blockchain platforms interacting with tangible assets is ensuring accurate representation. While digital assets might have established evaluation metrics, tangible properties, like real estate, often have subjective valuations. FS aims to devise a reliable valuation mechanism, merging professional expertise with community insights.

### Key Roles within FS

FS envisions a network where registered stakeholders offer services and are remunerated by FS. Given the nature of blockchain disagreements and the need for trust in real-world evaluations, we emphasize the verification of these stakeholders. Their roles span appraisers, inspectors, brokers, and notaries, among others.

### Market Dynamics & Tenancy

Investors, through FS, can trade fractional property shares on secondary markets, ensuring liquidity. In the realm of rentals, FS's primary objective is to lease acquired properties, ensuring competitive returns for investors. Tenants interface with a separate portal, and FS's competitive rates promise an edge over conventional rental markets.

### Key Advantages

Transitioning to a decentralized model offers economical capital access and a tangible solution to pressing socio-economic challenges. Collaboratively, with our FS pilot partners, we aim to redefine housing paradigms. Leveraging blockchain ensures data transparency and accessibility.

**For Investors:**
- Assured social returns via rental or financing agreements.
- Streamlined investment management.
- Fractional ownership of multiple properties.
- Secondary market access for trading property shares.

**For Tenants:**
- Commitment to affordability.
- Stability in leases and protection mechanisms.
- Future prospects of property ownership.

**For Other Stakeholders:**
All stakeholders contribute to FS's evolution. As we craft pilot models for sustainable, legally-compliant platforms, we actively seek collaborations with municipalities and housing associations eager to address housing challenges.

## How Fair Squares Operates

### FS Architecture
![Architecture FS main flow](/img/architecture-fs-process.png)

### Funding Framework

Users bond their capital to the housing fund via the platform interface, earmarking it for potential housing investments. This repository holds user-specific stable tokens. The core intent is housing investments, with the transparent, fair allocation of user investments.

### Property Listings

Property listings from homeowners, organizations, and

 real estate agencies are integrated onto the platform. Each listing goes through an extensive verification process, ensuring only genuine, viable properties are available.

### Voting & Governance

Investment decisions, steered by user consensus, determine property acquisitions. All token holders can actively participate in the democratic process, and decisions receive legal weight through on-chain governance mechanisms. This model promotes decentralized decision-making and instills ownership beyond property acquisition.

### Returns & Profit Sharing

FS's primary revenue stream is lease-based. The model promotes competitive rents and assures tenants' stability. Revenues are allocated to operational costs, then distributed to investors proportionally, ensuring an equitable return model. FS also offers a secondary market for investors to trade property shares and the option to sell their shares back to the fund.
